# LeetCode Daily Solutions — C++ & Python

This repository contains my **daily LeetCode solutions**, written mainly in **optimized C++** with occasional **Python** implementations.  
Each problem lives in its own folder, and all versions/attempts are preserved.

The solving order follows the **LearnYard DSA Practice Sheet** for structured and progressive DSA mastery.

## 📚 Problem Source

**LearnYard DSA Sheet:**  
https://learnyard.com/practice/dsa

I follow LearnYard’s DSA progression to systematically cover:
- Arrays & Strings  
- Hashing & Sliding Window  
- Linked Lists, Stacks & Queues  
- Trees & Graphs  
- Dynamic Programming and more  

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository mirrors LeetCode’s problem-based layout:

```text
/<ProblemName>/
    /version/cpp/*.cpp
    /version/python/*.py   (only when solved in Python)
    README.md              (problem statement or notes)
```

This keeps each problem **self-contained**, easy to navigate, and easy to map back to LeetCode.

## 🛠 Languages Used

### C++ (Primary)
- Optimized, STL-aware solutions  
- Competitive-programming style when useful  
- Focus on **time and space complexity**  
- Multiple versions kept to show iterative improvement  

### Python (Secondary)
- Used for alternate approaches  
- Helpful for quick prototyping and readability  

---

## 🧠 What Each Problem Folder Contains

Inside each `<ProblemName>/` directory, you’ll typically find:

- `version/cpp/*.cpp`  
  - One or more C++ implementations  
  - Older versions kept for reference

- `version/python/*.py` (only for some problems)  
  - Python implementations or experiments

- `README.md`  
  - Problem statement or notes  
  - Sometimes approach/explanation

---

## 🔎 Example Folder Names

Actual examples from the repository (pattern):

```text
/1-TwoSum
/11-ContainerWithMostWater
/104-MaximumDepthOfBinaryTree
/125-ValidPalindrome
/1260-Shift2DGrid
/1329-SorttheMatrixDiagonally
...
```

Each of these folders follows the same internal structure with `version/` directories and a problem-level README.

## 🎯 Goals

- Maintain **daily problem-solving discipline**  
- Build strong **DSA fundamentals** with a guided sheet  
- Improve **implementation clarity and efficiency** in C++  
- Preserve a full history of attempts, optimizations, and refactors
